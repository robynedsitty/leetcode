## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  array of strings  `words`  and a character  `x`.
Return  _an  **array of indices**  representing the words that contain the character_ `x`.

**Note**  that the returned array may be in  **any**  order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 50`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
-   `x`  is a lowercase English letter.
-   `words[i]`  consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Answer
**Python Attempt 1 - Runtime 10ms:**
-   loop through each word
-   convert word to a set - takes O(length of word) time
```
class Solution(object):
    def findWordsContaining(self, words, x):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type x: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = []
        index = 0
        

        #for each word in words array
        for word in words:
            currword = set(word)

            #for each letter in the current word
            if x in currword:
                ans.append(index)
                
            index += 1
        
        return ans
```

**Python Attempt 2 - Runtime 0ms:**
-   loop through each word with index using enumerate
-   `x in word` is O(length of word) worst case
-   avoids the overhead of allocating and populating a set
-   less memory usage
```
class Solution(object):
    def findWordsContaining(self, words, x):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type x: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = []
        #for each index and word in words array
        for index, word in enumerate(words):
            
            #check letter x in word
            if x in word:
                ans.append(index)
                
        
        return ans
```
