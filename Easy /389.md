## Problem

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `t.length == s.length + 1`
-   `s` and `t` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Answer
**Java Attempt 1 - Runtime 9ms - Complexity O(N<sup>2</sup>):**
-   convert string `s` into a `list` of characters
-   check and remove the first occurance of character from `t` in list
-   check remaining list for each character
-   return character of the value that wasn't found
```
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char ans = ' '; 

        //list of characters
        List<Character> list = new ArrayList<>();

        //for each char in string s
        for(char i : s.toCharArray()){
            //add char i in the list
            list.add(i);
        }

        //for each char in string t
        for(char i : t.toCharArray()){
            //remove the first occurance of char i in list
            //cast i to remove object i
            //if character i was not found in list, return i
            if(!list.remove((Character) i)){
                return i;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Java Attempt 2 - Runtime 1ms - Complexity O(N):**
-   calculate the ascii value for t and s and subtract them to find the difference
-   return the char of the difference
-   loop through `t` once - O(n+1)
-   loop through `s` once - O(n)
```
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        
        //store difference of ASCII values between s and t
        int difference = 0;

        //for each char i in string t
        for(char i : t.toCharArray()){
            difference += i; //add all ASCII values from t
        }

        //for each char i in string s
        for(char i : s.toCharArray()){
            difference -= i; //subtract all ASCII values from s
        }

        //return the character of the difference
        return (char) difference;
    }
}
```
