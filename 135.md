## Problem

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the *minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == ratings.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴`
-   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10⁴`

## Answer
**Python Attempt 1 - Runtime 257ms:**
-   create array filled with 1's
-   for loop left to right
-   for loop right to left
```
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        candies = [1] * len(ratings) #create candies array filled with 1's

        #left to right
        for child in range(1, len(ratings)): #start from 1, avoid comparing to last element(wrap around)
            if ratings[child] > ratings[child-1]: #compare to prev child
                candies[child] = candies[child-1] + 1

        #right to left
        for child in range(len(ratings) -2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[child] > ratings[child+1]: #compare to prev child
                candies[child] = max(candies[child], candies[child+1] + 1)

        #return sum
        return sum(candies)
```

**Python Attempt 2 - Runtime 22ms:**
-   same code from attempt 1
-   set variable for len(ratings) to avoid constantly calculating length
-   sum answer before returning
```
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        num = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * num #create candies array filled with 1's

        #left to right
        for child in range(1, num): #start from 1, avoid comparing to last element(wrap around)
            if ratings[child] > ratings[child-1]: #compare to prev child
                candies[child] = candies[child-1] + 1

        #right to left
        for child in range(num -2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[child] > ratings[child+1]: #compare to prev child
                candies[child] = max(candies[child], candies[child+1] + 1)

        ans = sum(candies)
        #return sum
        return ans
```
